      "As of my knowledge cutoff in June 2024, there is **no widely recognized product called the \"AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie.\"** Boie is a well-known brand that specializes in personal care products, particularly toothbrushes and body scrubbers made from antimicrobial, BPA-free, and recyclable materials. Their toothbrushes are known for being gentle, durable, and eco-friendly, but they are not typically marketed as \"smart\" toothbrushes (i.e., with Bluetooth connectivity, app integration, or sensors).\n",

      "### What Boie Offers:\n",
      "- **Boie Toothbrush:** Ultra-soft, flexible bristles, minimalist design, and a replaceable head.\n",
      "- **Eco-Friendly:** Made from recyclable materials and designed to last longer than traditional toothbrushes.\n",
      "- **Antimicrobial:** The material resists bacterial growth.\n",
      "- **UltraSlim:** Boie does offer a \"Slim\" version of their toothbrush, which is thinner and more compact.\n",
      "\n",
      "### \"Smart\" Toothbrushes:\n",
      "- Typically, \"smart\" toothbrushes are made by brands like Oral-B, Philips Sonicare, or Colgate, featuring Bluetooth, pressure sensors, and app connectivity.\n",
      "- Boie does **not** currently offer a smart toothbrush with these features.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possibilities:\n",
      "- If \"AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie\" is a **new or upcoming product** released after June 2024, there may not be public information available yet.\n",
